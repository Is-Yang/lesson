        Hi, Parents and Teachers,
        <br />
        <br /> I am Xizhi, the developer of Neural Parallel Language and the 3d animation & game making tool called Paracraft.
        In 1989, at the age of 7, I wrote my first program on a IBM PC in my fatherâ€™s lab. From March 2018, I made a decision
        to create one computer science lesson every week using Paracraft and NPL.
        <br /> Throughout the lessons, I want to share my first 12 years of programming life with all kids around the world including
        my own. Click here to read my autobiography on programming.
        <br />
        <br /> All software used in the lessons are free and open source, including paracraft and NPL. All lessons we sell are
        also free to read online, and we only charge you a small subscription fee in order for your kids to read the source
        code of the animation or game while they play it. We encourage you to see the lessons yourself and read together
        with your kids, as I would do the same thing with my own child.
        <br />
        <br /> I have a small International team that is doing Artificial Intelligence research using NPL and paracraft. The software
        and language that is taught in our lessons is the same set of tools we use for our serious research in AI. Our NPL
        research center at Tatfook has open sourced over 2 million lines of code written by ourselves on github. Your payment
        or donation will greatly help us to continue our work with more and more talented programmers and scientists.
        <br />
        <br /> Finally, if you or your kids want to join us one day, please email me: lixizhi@yeah.net
        <br />
        <br /> Best
        <br /> Xizhi, Li
        <br /> CTO of Tatfook Network Co.
